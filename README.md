### Hello! I'm Toledo and I'm pleased to meet you! 😋

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, Javascript and Reactjs !
- 📫 How to reach me: [My Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/toledo2k).
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm very into Retrowave, Synthwave and Outrun music style, also I'm THAT D&D and Cyberpunk genre fan lol 🤣
